## Question

How to ensure that "I've got this" message does not come through as "Yes, I will take yet another side project"? Or, in other words, how to make sure that you are not agreeing to overworking by showing yourself as that one person in the team that can figure everything out. Especially in smaller teams, I can imagine a scenario where all the projects "on the edge of one's ability" can quickly be assumed to be assigned to those who perform better and developed such trust with the boss through this messaging.
