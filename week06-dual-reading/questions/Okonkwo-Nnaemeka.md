## Question
If Chapter 4 in HYBHY emphasizes taking responsibility to build trust with a manager, and Chapter 8 in POSS emphasizes sharing responsibility to build community, what actually distinguishes healthy leadership from quiet control? At what point does saying “I got this” turn into gatekeeping in open source or over-managing in a traditional workplace?
