## Question

To what extent should the social credit system of a team (including managers) be explicit, as opposed to implied?

## Context (optional)

Both chapters establish general guidelines for social credit and expectations from the approach of explicit documents, such as COMMITERS.md, and through implicit means, such as understanding how people are likely to react in different situations. I imagine that these 'social contracts' are living documents that update in dialogue with the politics of the project, but there must also be a process for deciding what is worth adding and what isn't.
