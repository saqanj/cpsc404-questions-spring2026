## Question

HYBHY Chapter 4 stresses sending the “two important messages” to your boss—being clear about what you’re doing and surfacing constraints/risks early—while Producing OSS Chapter 8 focuses on managing participants by setting norms, using public communication, and making decisions in a way that scales.

When a team has lots of contributors (like an OSS project), what’s the best way to apply HYBHY’s “two messages” **without** bypassing the public process and creating resentment or confusion? Specifically: if you spot a problem (scope creep, a toxic participant, or a review bottleneck), what should be communicated **privately** to the leader vs **publicly** to the group so you keep transparency and trust but still get decisive action?
