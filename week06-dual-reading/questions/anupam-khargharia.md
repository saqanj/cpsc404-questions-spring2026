## Question
The manager chapter basically advises you to protect your manager’s image to their boss by using “we” and sharing credit/blame. That makes sense as career strategy, but is it always right? If your manager repeatedly makes bad calls, does “having their back” become enabling? Where’s the ethical boundary between being a team player and helping someone avoid accountability?
