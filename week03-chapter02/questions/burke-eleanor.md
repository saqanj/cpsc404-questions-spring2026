## Question 1

In school, we often have trusted sources, such as textbooks, TAs, and professors, to help us answer questions. If are new to the work force and our manager ask us a question we know little about, how do we find sources that will help us find a "good-enough" answer. 

## Question 2

Often women, and other identities under-represented in Tech, are underestimated in work environments and it can be scary (for lack of a better word) to admitt you don't know something. Are there other ways to create a "good enough" answer without discounting your authority/ ablity by admitting you don't know something. This can also apply to tims you need to ask for help but don't want to come off as under qualified.
