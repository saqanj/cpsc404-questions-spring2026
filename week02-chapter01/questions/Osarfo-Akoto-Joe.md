## Question
### Theme: Overlapping Agendas 
The text suggests that while employee and manager agendas overlap, they are not identical because managers prioritize "Is This Good for the Company?" while professionals prioritize autonomy and mastery being able to learn and experiment as they please. 

**Discussion:** Is there a way to further overlap agendas by introducing ideas such as "what can benefit the workers can benefit the company" or do some parts of each agenda exist with a strict binary?
