## Chapter 1 Question

The authors frame conflict with managers as inevitable and even desirable, arguing that differing goals create opportunities for mutual gain (“it’s not a bug; it’s a feature”). How can employees practically treat conflict as a feature rather than a liability when their manager controls evaluations, promotions, or job security? At what point does structural power imbalance limit the productivity of conflict?
