### Nicole Balbuena Gutierrez - Week 2 Disucssion Question

##Question:##
HYBHY Chapter 1 argues that conflict is inevitable and can be productive. How can leaders design team norms that encourage productive disagreement without creating an environment where conflict becomes personal or unsafe?

In a high-velocity environment like Investment Banking, where 'junior teams' (Analysts and Associates) iteratively refine complex deliverables (like CIMs and Financial Models) before they ever reach senior decision-makers (VPs or MDs), does the Associate function as the 'Manager' defined in this text? Furthermore, how can a first-year Analyst apply the 'Professionals Advise; Managers Decide' framework to provide critical feedback on these iterations without disrupting the workflow or undermining the Associate’s authority?
